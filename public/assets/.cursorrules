# Asset Management Guidelines for AI Assistant

## Asset Organization
The assets directory follows this structure:
- `/models`: 3D models organized by category
  - `/models/spaceships`: Player and NPC spacecraft
  - `/models/asteroids`: Various asteroid types
  - `/models/planets`: Planetary bodies and moons
  - `/models/environment`: Environmental props and structures
- `/textures`: Texture maps organized by category
- `/audio`: Sound effects and music tracks
- `/shaders`: GLSL shader files

## Model Guidelines
- All models should be in glTF/GLB format
- Optimize models for web (reduce polygon count, texture size)
- Use PBR materials when possible
- Include proper UV mapping for textures
- Apply appropriate scale (1 unit = 1 meter)
- Orient models with Y-up coordinate system
- Include embedded animations when applicable

## Texture Guidelines
- Use power-of-two dimensions (512x512, 1024x1024, etc.)
- Save as compressed formats when possible (WebP, compressed PNG)
- Organize PBR textures with consistent naming:
  - `name_baseColor.png`
  - `name_normal.png`
  - `name_metallicRoughness.png`
  - `name_emissive.png`
- Use texture atlases for related small textures

## Audio Guidelines
- Format: Use MP3 for music, WebM or MP3 for sound effects
- Normalize audio levels across all sound effects
- Keep sound effects short and focused
- Use spatial audio properties for 3D positioning

## Loading and Performance
- All assets are loaded through their respective manager classes
- Large assets should be loaded asynchronously
- Critical assets should be preloaded at startup
- Consider using LOD (Level of Detail) for complex models
- Implement progressive loading for large scenes

## Naming Conventions
- Use descriptive, lowercase names with hyphens
- Include category in filename (e.g., `spaceship-fighter.glb`)
- Version assets with suffixes when iterating (e.g., `asteroid-large-v2.glb`)
- Follow a consistent naming pattern within each asset category
