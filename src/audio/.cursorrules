# Audio System Guidelines

## Audio Overview
The audio directory contains all audio-related systems and components:
- Sound effects management
- Music playback and transitions
- Audio spatialization for 3D sound
- Volume control and audio settings
- Audio preloading and caching
- Sound pools for frequently used effects

## Architecture Principles
- Implement a centralized audio manager
- Separate concerns between music and sound effects
- Use event-based triggering for gameplay sounds
- Support dynamic volume adjustment
- Implement proper audio cleanup and disposal

## Implementation Guidelines
- Use the Web Audio API for precise audio control
- Implement audio sprites for small, frequent sound effects
- Create an abstraction layer over the Web Audio API
- Support both positional and non-positional audio
- Implement proper audio loading states (loading, ready, error)

## Sound Effects Guidelines
- Use consistent volume levels across sound effects
- Implement variation in repeated sounds
- Use appropriate audio formats (mp3, ogg) with fallbacks
- Implement distance-based volume attenuation
- Create sound categories for volume control (UI, gameplay, ambient)

## Music Guidelines
- Implement smooth transitions between music tracks
- Support looping with proper loop points
- Create layered music systems for dynamic gameplay
- Adjust music volume based on game context
- Implement fade in/out for music transitions

## Performance Considerations
- Limit the number of simultaneous audio sources
- Implement audio object pooling
- Preload critical audio assets
- Use audio compression appropriate for web delivery
- Implement distance-based culling for 3D audio sources

## Mobile Considerations
- Handle audio autoplay restrictions on mobile devices
- Implement touch-to-start audio for mobile browsers
- Adjust audio quality based on device capabilities
- Implement proper audio interruption handling for calls/notifications
- Support background audio pause when app loses focus

## Accessibility
- Provide visual alternatives for important audio cues
- Allow independent volume control for different audio categories
- Support audio description features when appropriate
- Implement captions for narrative content
- Allow disabling specific audio categories
