 # Asset Management Guidelines for Side-Scroller Game

## Asset Organization
The assets directory follows this structure:
- `/models`: 3D models organized by category (for 2.5D elements)
  - `/models/characters`: Player and enemy character models
  - `/models/props`: Interactive and decorative objects
  - `/models/environment`: Environmental elements and structures
- `/sprites`: 2D sprite assets
  - `/sprites/characters`: Character sprite sheets
  - `/sprites/animations`: Animation sprite sheets
  - `/sprites/ui`: User interface elements
  - `/sprites/effects`: Visual effects and particles
- `/backgrounds`: Background layers and parallax elements
  - `/backgrounds/foreground`: Closest parallax layers
  - `/backgrounds/midground`: Middle parallax layers
  - `/backgrounds/background`: Distant parallax layers
- `/audio`: Sound effects and music tracks
  - `/audio/music`: Background music and themes
  - `/audio/sfx`: Sound effects organized by type
  - `/audio/ambient`: Ambient and environmental sounds

## Sprite Guidelines
- Use consistent sprite sizes within character sets
- Create sprite sheets with uniform grid layouts
- Include appropriate transparent padding around sprites
- Use power-of-two dimensions for optimal performance
- Organize animation frames sequentially
- Include sprite data JSON files with frame information
- Design sprites at 2x resolution for high-DPI displays
- Maintain consistent art style across all sprites

## Background Guidelines
- Design backgrounds as seamlessly tileable for infinite scrolling
- Create multiple parallax layers for depth (typically 3-5 layers)
- Use consistent dimensions for each parallax category
- Ensure smooth transitions between background themes
- Include variants for different environmental conditions
- Design backgrounds with proper contrast for gameplay visibility

## Model Guidelines (for 2.5D elements)
- All models should be in glTF/GLB format
- Optimize models for web (reduce polygon count, texture size)
- Use simple materials for consistent style
- Apply appropriate scale to fit with 2D elements
- Orient models with Y-up coordinate system
- Design models to work with orthographic camera view
- Consider using billboarding techniques for optimization

## Texture Guidelines
- Use power-of-two dimensions (512x512, 1024x1024, etc.)
- Save as compressed formats when possible (WebP, compressed PNG)
- Use texture atlases for related small textures
- Implement proper mipmapping for distant textures
- Consider memory usage on mobile devices

## Audio Guidelines
- Format: Use MP3 for music, WebM or MP3 for sound effects
- Normalize audio levels across all sound effects
- Keep sound effects short and focused
- Design layered music for dynamic gameplay
- Create alternative shorter loops for repeated actions
- Implement variations for common sound effects

## Loading and Performance
- All assets are loaded through their respective manager classes
- Large assets should be loaded asynchronously
- Critical assets should be preloaded at startup
- Implement level-specific asset loading
- Use progressive loading for large levels
- Consider texture compression for mobile devices

## Naming Conventions
- Use descriptive, lowercase names with hyphens
- Include category in filename (e.g., `character-hero-idle.png`)
- Version assets with suffixes when iterating (e.g., `background-forest-v2.png`)
- Follow a consistent naming pattern within each asset category
- Use numbering for sequential frames (e.g., `character-run-01.png`)
