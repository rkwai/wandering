# Cosmic Wanderer - 3D Space Simulation

A web-based 3D space simulator featuring realistic physics, procedural generation, and immersive gameplay. Built with Three.js and modern web technologies.

## Features

- **Advanced Space Physics**: Realistic inertia, momentum, and drift provide an authentic space flight experience
- **Procedural Universe**: Endless exploration with dynamically generated asteroids, debris fields, and cosmic phenomena
- **Immersive Environment**: Stunning visuals including stars, nebulae, distant planets, and cosmic dust
- **Responsive Controls**: Intuitive piloting system with multiple control schemes and camera views
- **Collision System**: Realistic interaction with space objects including physics-based responses

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed (version 14.x or above recommended).

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cosmic-wanderer.git
   cd cosmic-wanderer
   ```

2. Install dependencies
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server
   ```
   npm start
   ```

4. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`

### Production Build

To create an optimized production build:
```
npm run build
```

## Controls

### Spaceship Movement

- **W** - Forward thrust
- **S** - Brake/reverse thrust
- **A/D** - Roll left/right
- **Q/E** - Strafe left/right
- **R/F** - Strafe up/down
- **Arrow Up/Down** - Pitch control
- **Arrow Left/Right** - Yaw control
- **Shift** - Boost (2x speed)
- **Space** - Afterburner (3x speed)
- **Z** - Stabilize ship orientation

### Camera Controls

- **V** - Toggle between first-person and third-person views
- **Mouse** - Look/control ship orientation (when pointer lock is active)
- **Click on game window** - Engage pointer lock for mouse controls

## Space Environment

The simulator features a rich and diverse space environment:

- **Asteroid Fields**: Navigate through dense asteroid fields with varying sizes and compositions
- **Space Debris**: Encounter random space debris ranging from small particles to larger fragments
- **Cosmic Phenomena**: Experience visually stunning space effects including nebulae and dust clouds
- **Star Systems**: Distant stars with varying colors and intensities
- **Deep Space**: Venture into the void with reduced debris density for high-speed travel

## Technical Details

- Built with **Three.js** for WebGL-based 3D rendering
- Uses **SimplexNoise** for procedural generation
- Implements custom physics for space flight mechanics
- Optimized for performance with dynamic LOD (Level of Detail) system
- Fully modular code architecture allowing for easy extension

## Planned Features

- Upgradeable spacecraft with different flight characteristics
- Advanced weapon systems for combat scenarios
- Mining and resource collection mechanics
- Multiplayer capabilities
- Dynamic mission system
